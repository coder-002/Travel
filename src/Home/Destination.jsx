          <h2>Jumla</h2>
          <p>
            Jumla District, one of the famous touristic destinations of Karnali
            Province of Nepal, covers an area of 2,531 km2. Gateway to famous
            mountains like Mount Kailash and Mount Kanjiroba, Jumla is a
            junction for tourists to want to explore Karnali Region and Dolpo.
            Lying at an altitude of 2,730 m, Jumla Village is hidden in the
            Sisne Himalaya foothills and is one of the least developed and
            inaccessible areas of the country. Foreign-aid workers initially
            visited the Jumla region, and people came to supply relief to the
            locals. But with the popularity of trekking trails to Dolpo and
            Karnali Region, Jumla is now flooded with trekkers and wanders.
            Jumla, which opens the gate to Rara National Park with outstanding
            Rara Lake, has become one of the popular destinations of Western
            Nepal. Photographers, vloggers, and trekkers have made the region
            alluring through their experiences and pictures. Bahun, Chhetri, and
            Gurung being the major ethnic groups of Jumla, Nepali and Gurung,
            are mainly spoken language. The best time to travel Jumla is between
            October to December and April to February. The trails are muddy and
            risky during monsoon, so it is better to avoid during the rainy
            season. You can find a local bus or also take flight from Kathmandu
            to Jumla Airport.

          <h2> Ghandruk</h2>
          <p>
            A village in the Modi Khola Valley of Nepal’s Annapurna region,
            Ghandruk offers panoramas of the surrounding Annapurna massif,
            including good views of Annapurna I, the world’s tenth-highest
            mountain. And yet, the village only stands at around 2,000 m (6,562
            ft), meaning you can look out over snow-drenched Himalaya peaks
            without needing to trek at altitude. Visiting Ghandruk also gives
            you a snapshot of everyday local life in Nepal’s mountains,
            especially that of the Gurung people. The whole place hums with
            activity, and you can soak it all up over a leisurely couple of
            days, sipping tea and wandering amid streets strung with prayer
            flags. You can also take day walks from here, which give you the
            chance to ascend a little further for even better views. Or, explore
            the village’s links with the Gurkhas, a unit in the British Army
            with a storied history.
